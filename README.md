# Ocaml `where`

Haskell's `where` is pretty great. If you have a bunch of chained `let`s, like this:

```haskell
-- NOTE: Haskell code; computes (x + 2) * 2
foo x = let y = x+2
          let z = y*2
          in z
```

â€¦ and write them much cleaner here:

```haskell
-- NOTE: Haskell code
foo x = z
  where y = x+2
        z = y*2
```

Surprisingly, OCaml doesn't support this syntax! So, I wrote this patch, which changes OCaml so that something like the `where` clause is allowed. For technical reasons (an important rule is right-associative), the syntax is somewhat different:

```haskell
-- OCaml version
foo x = z
  where y = x+2 and
        z = y*2
```

Note the use of `and` to separate bindings here. This is necessary between every binding:

```haskell
-- Moar OCaml stuff
foo x = x'''
  where x'   = x+2 and
        x''  = x'*2 and
        x''' = y''+2
```

You're welcome, hardcore `where` fans! :)


# Running the demo

Run with `make run_test`

The output will inform you that this code:

```
let x = z
  where y = 10 and
        z = 20
```

will desugar to this code:

```
let x =
  let y = 10 in
  let z = 20 in
  z
```

This is exactly what we desire---the `where` simply desugars into a list of `let`s.

So, how does this work? If you look at the makefile, you'll see the syntax extension (*i.e.*, `where.ml`) gets compiled and then linked in to compiling the test file (*i.e.*, `test.ml`) at compile time.
